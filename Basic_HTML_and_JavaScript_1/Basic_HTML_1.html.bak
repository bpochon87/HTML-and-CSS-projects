					      One might immediately assume that a dichotomy is created: good and bad.  This isn't so.  <br>
						  Good encompasses all: great, good, fair, bad, poor, all of these markers.</p>

							other labels or one that can stand as a <font size="6">broad category</font>.  This <font size="6">broad category</font> <br>
							may	accept all comers, knowing that any one of them can be substituted out for it.</p>
