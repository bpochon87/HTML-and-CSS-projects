	<h2>Beep Beep Boop</h2>
	
		<p>Many people wonder when the computers will take over.<br>
		   As long as they beep, beep, boop, they won't.
		
	<h2>Cats do not own VCRs</h2>
	
		<p>A common misconception is that many cats own VCRs.  While<br>
		   there once was compelling evidence, Bear Dog of the Cat<br>
	       Institute of Latin America had this to say:</p>
	   
	   <blockquote><i>"There just isn't any evidence."</i></blockquote>
	<p>   
	   Thanks, Bear Dog.
