		<h3>Some thing</h3>
	<p>To be in such a wonderful position,<br>
	I have to question.<br>
	Is this existence something real?<br>
	Or am I just a transient ghost?<br>
	Crossing the ever expanding universe,<br>
	the cold, dark streams of the mind.<br>
	Something seems real here...<br>
	Some things, they seem real.</p>

		<h3>Must I Know?</h3>
	<p>Apparently there are more efficient ways to speak.<br>
	Must I know?<br>
	Evidently there is more money to be made.<br>
	Must I know?<br>
	Seemingly the universe can be contradicted.<br>
	Must I know?<br>
	Apparently I really don't know shit.<br>
