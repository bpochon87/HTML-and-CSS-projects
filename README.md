<h2>Black Cat | The Resort</h2>
A mock website for time spent with a cat (more specifically my cat, Suerte [Suerte means lucky in Spanish. Origin story upon request]). It is styled with CSS and
contains a navbar, flex-box image containers, and a form.

<h2>Silver City Cinema</h2>
A mock website for a movie theater that no longer exists in Leadville, CO. Utilized Bootstrap 4 to implement several components from their preconfigured HTML
elements including the:
<ul>
    <li>Navbar,</li>
    <li>Jumbotron,</li>
    <li>Form,</li>
    <li>Cards, and</li>
    <li>Dropdowns.</li>
</ul>
      
<h2>Brady's Portfolio Website</h2>
This is my personal website that I designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
