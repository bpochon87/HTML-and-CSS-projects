	<h1>Nihilism</h1>
	
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Quotes">
		<p>There are no facts, only interpretations - <i>Friedrich Nietzsche</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	
		<p>Nihilism requires the rejection of all religious and moral principles.
		   This ideology believes that life is meaningless.</p>

	<h3>Mono no aware</h3>
	
	<blockquote cite="https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/mono-no-aware/#:~:text=He%20wrote%3A%20'To%20know%20mono,stirred%20by%20each%20of%20them'.">
		<p>To know mono no aware is to discern the power and essence, not just of the<br> 
		moon and the cherry blossoms, but of every single thing existing in this world,<br>
		and to be stirred by each of them - <i>Motoori Norinaga</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	
		<p>Mono no aware is a Japanese philosophy describing a gentle sadness
		   at the transience of all things.  It isn't meant to be self-loathing
		   or depression but rather the observation that all phenomena passes
		   by and appreciation mixed with compassion for its transient state is
		   okay to be felt.</p>

	<h6>Wu wei</h6>
	<p><a href="http://www.taoofeastwood.com/assets/images/chapter/wu_wei.svg">Wu wei written in Chinese</a></p>
	
	<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2540.Wei_Wu_Wei">
		<p>Why are you unhappy? Because 99.9 percent of everything you think, and of<br> 
		   everything you do, is for yourself—and there isn’t one. - <i>Wei Wu Wei</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	
		<p>Wu Wei is a Chinese philosophy akin to the pointlessness mentioned
		   above.  It means "non-doing" or "doing nothing" in Chinese.  However,
		   this doesn't mean laziness or profound apathy.  Quite succinctly one
		   could say that doing something to the outer world has the same effect
		   that doing nothing would.  The stream of life cannot be held back and
		   one's attempt to affect it would be as strident an attempt as doing
		   nothing to affect it.</p>
